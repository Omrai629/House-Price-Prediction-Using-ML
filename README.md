# House_Price_Prediction_Using_ML
In this Project I have implemented 3 regression techniques namely - Linear Regression , KNN and Random Forest Regression on  a housing dataset to predict the price of a House and then evaluated the models on the metrics like mean absolute error,mean square error ,root mean square error and r2 score.
Steps of implementation:
1) Importing Libraries
2) Importing dataset
3) Exploratory Data Analysis
4) Data Visualization
5) Preprocessing and splitting of Data
6) Data Modelling
7) Evaluation of models
